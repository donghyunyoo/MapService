# Setting up the MapService Server

## Requirements

Before you get started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

- [Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- Component from Eclipse Marketplace
  - [IBM Eclipse Tools for IBM Cloud](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/tools-IBM_Eclipse_Tools_for_IBM_Cloud)
  
  Please use "Eclipse Java EE IDE with IBM Cloud Tools Package" for now.
http://eclipse.bluemix.net/packages/epp.bmt/

  - [IBM Liberty Developer Tools for Eclipse](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/tools-IBM_Liberty_Developer_Tools_for_Eclipse_Oxygen)

## Database

The server can use one of the follwing database system

1. [IBM Cloudant](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant)
2. MongoDB at localhost

## Deploy MapService Server

After you setup Eclipse, you have the following options to deploy server.

1. Define IBM Bluemix Server. Then push MapService app to Bluemix  
[Liberty for Java / Getting started tutorial](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/liberty/getting-started.html)  
[Develop applications using IBM Eclipse Tools for IBM Cloud](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/liberty/eclipseDevelop.html)  
[Deploying apps with IBM Eclipse Tools for IBM Cloud](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/eclipsetools/eclipsetools.html)  
[Eclipse tools for IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/eclipse)  
[Build and deploy a sample Liberty application to Bluemix](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-libertyapp-bluemix/index.html)  
[Options for pushing Liberty apps](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/liberty/optionsForPushing.html)

2. Setup your own J2EE Container (WAS Liberty recommneended). Then deploy server manually.  
[WebSphere Liberty](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/)

After you deploy MapService Server, you need to add a DB service
- If you are not using Bluemix, you need to provide `VCAP_SERVICES` Environment variable
- If `VCAP_SERVICES` is not provided, it tries to connect to Mongo DB at localhost:27017 

You need to add the following environment variable for administoration instances
- ENABLE_MAP_ACCESS=admin,auditor,editor

## Administration

Open https://`your_app_name`.mybluemix.net/admin.jsp

Please login with initial administrator account:
- User id : `hulopadmin`
- Password: `please change password`

**Important:** Please change admin password NOW!

You also need to create new editor account.

## Setting Indoor Floor Map (Optional)

Create Attachment zip file with the following files:

- map/floormaps.json file
```
[
	{
		"id": "<id of floor map>",
		"image": "<url of floor plan image>",
		"floor": <floor number>,
		"origin_x": <origin x>,
		"origin_y": <origin y>,
		"width": <width of image>,
		"height": <height of image>,
		"ppm_x": <pixels per meter x>,
		"ppm_y": <pixels per meter y>,
		"lat": <latitude>,
		"lng": <longitude>,
		"rotate": <rotate angle>
	},
	
	{
	    ... 
	},
	
	{
	    ... 
	}
]
```

- floor plan image files.

Import Attachment zip file using Administration console


## Edit Network Route

Open https://`your_app_name`.mybluemix.net/editor.jsp

Please login with editor account.

## Testing Navigation

Use https://`your_app_name`.mybluemix.net/mobile.jsp?id=`your_unique_device_id`

## Setting OpenLayers Tile Map Service

Open Street Map (OSM) is used for Tile Map Service by default. You can OSM for initial test. 

However, heavy use of OSM is prohibited. See https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/ 

You need to provide your Tile Map Service via Environment Variable as follows:

HULOP\_TILE\_SERVER
- URL of tile service.
- Example: `https://{a-c}.tile.example.com/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?apikey=your_api_key`

HULOP\_TILE\_ATTR
- Attribution information.
- Example: `Maps © <a href="http://www.example.com">Example</a>, Data © <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap contributors</a>`
